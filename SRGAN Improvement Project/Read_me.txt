"This directory contains only one model due to the upload size restrictions in the courses. Specifically, it includes the RRDB_ESRGAN_x4 model, which is the minimum necessary for executing the provided code. It's important to note that the source code encompasses additional models, such as PSNR and others, that can be utilized to achieve more impressive results. For a comprehensive understanding of the available models and their potential to enhance outcomes, please review the source code.

Additionally, please be aware that the 'helper' may not work in this folder as the PSNR model is not available here due to size restriction on upload. However, the source code in the Google Drive folder contains all models, ensuring functionality if that folder is used."
